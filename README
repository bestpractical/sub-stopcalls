NAME
    Sub::StopCalls - stop sub calls (make it a constant)

SYNOPSIS
        my $i = 0;

        sub boo {
            return foo();
        }
        sub foo {
            $i++;
            return Sub::StopCalls->do();
        }

        print "$i\n"; # 0
        boo();
        print "$i\n"; # 1
        boo();
        print "$i\n"; # 1

DESCRIPTION
    Module provides a way to stop further calls into a function from the
    current caller.

    Now it's a proof of concept that works under perl 5.13.x and in void
    context only.
